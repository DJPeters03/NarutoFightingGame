# Naruto 3v3 Turn-Based Fighting Game (Chakra RPS)

This is a simple browser-based Naruto fighting game, where you draft **3 shinobi each** (you vs AI) and fight in a **turn-based rock-paper-scissors chakra system**.

## Features
- Full roster of Naruto characters (main cast, Akatsuki, Kage, Jinchūriki, etc.).
- Each character has **HP** and **3 jutsu** with different damage and chakra element.
- Chakra RPS cycle:
  - Wind ▶ Lightning
  - Lightning ▶ Earth
  - Earth ▶ Water
  - Water ▶ Fire
  - Fire ▶ Wind
- Advantage = ×1.5 damage, Disadvantage = ×0.75 damage.
- **Draft Phase**: Pick your 3 fighters, AI drafts too.
- **Battle Phase**: Take turns selecting a ninja, their jutsu, and a target.
- **AI** is completely random (random actor, random target, random jutsu).

## How to Run
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3. Draft your team and start fighting!

## File Structure
- `index.html` — main page and UI layout.
- `roster.js` — Naruto characters and their stats/jutsu.
- `game.js` — all battle logic, drafting, AI, and UI interactivity.
